What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a hidden .git file that contains the metadata regarding
the various versions of files maintained in the that repository. Git needs to know what 
folders you wish to make repositories in.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermitent step that one can use before commiting changes to a repository. The value of this
is being able to commit multiple files in a directory to a repository at once. This capability allows users more 
flexibility to have their commit messages be more cohesive and organized.
