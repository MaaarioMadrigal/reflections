When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful if you are working on a project in more than one physical location or if you are working
on a project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual updating is preferred because automated updates might pull changes down that conflict or cause you to lose work that you currently have in progress on your local branch.
